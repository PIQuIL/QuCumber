	abstract = {Artificial neural networks have been recently introduced as a general ansatz to represent many-body wave functions. In conjunction with variational Monte Carlo calculations, this ansatz has been applied to find Hamiltonian ground states and their energies. Here, we provide extensions of this method to study excited states, a central task in several many-body quantum calculations. First, we give a prescription that allows us to target eigenstates of a (nonlocal) symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Second, we give an algorithm to compute low-lying excited states without symmetries. We demonstrate our approach with both restricted Boltzmann machines and feed-forward neural networks. Results are shown for the one-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg model, and for the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. When comparing to exact results, we obtain good agreement for a large range of excited-states energies. Interestingly, we find that deep networks typically outperform shallow architectures for high-energy states.},

	title = {Neural-network states for the classical simulation of quantum computing},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05232},
	abstract = {Simulating quantum algorithms with classical resources generally requires exponential resources. However, heuristic classical approaches are often very efficient in approximately simulating special circuit structures, for example with limited entanglement, or based on one-dimensional geometries. Here we introduce a classical approach to the simulation of general quantum circuits based on neural-network quantum states (NQS) representations. Considering a set of universal quantum gates, we derive rules for exactly applying single-qubit and two-qubit Z rotations to NQS, whereas we provide a learning scheme to approximate the action of Hadamard gates. Results are shown for the Hadamard and Fourier transform of entangled initial states for systems sizes and total circuit depths exceeding what can be currently simulated with state-of-the-art brute-force techniques. The overall accuracy obtained by the neural-network states based on Restricted Boltzmann machines is satisfactory, and offers a classical route to simulating highly-entangled circuits. In the test cases considered, we find that our classical simulations are comparable to quantum simulations affected by an incoherent noise level in the hardware of about \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ per gate.},

	abstract = {Neural-network quantum states have recently been introduced as an Ansatz for describing the wave function of quantum many-body systems. We show that there are strong connections between neural-network quantum states in the form of restricted Boltzmann machines and some classes of tensor-network states in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate that short-range restricted Boltzmann machines are entangled plaquette states, while fully connected restricted Boltzmann machines are string-bond states with a nonlocal geometry and low bond dimension. These results shed light on the underlying architecture of restricted Boltzmann machines and their efficiency at representing many-body quantum states. String-bond states also provide a generic way of enhancing the power of neural-network quantum states and a natural generalization to systems with larger local Hilbert space. We compare the advantages and drawbacks of these different classes of states and present a method to combine them together. This allows us to benefit from both the entanglement structure of tensor networks and the efficiency of neural-network quantum states into a single Ansatz capable of targeting the wave function of strongly correlated systems. While it remains a challenge to describe states with chiral topological order using traditional tensor networks, we show that, because of their nonlocal geometry, neural-network quantum states and their string-bond-state extension can describe a lattice fractional quantum Hall state exactly. In addition, we provide numerical evidence that neural-network quantum states can approximate a chiral spin liquid with better accuracy than entangled plaquette states and local string-bond states. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of neural networks to describe complex quantum wave functions and pave the way towards the use of string-bond states as a tool in more traditional machine-learning applications.},
