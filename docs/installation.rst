========================
Installation
========================

QuCumber only supports Python 3, not Python 2. If you are using Python 2,
please update! You may also want to install PyTorch v1.0 (https://pytorch.org/),
if you have not already.

If you're running a reasonably up-to-date Linux or macOS system, PyTorch should
get installed automatically when you install QuCumber with `pip`.
